🏁🏎️ Analyzing Tire Strategies in the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix 📊🔧

I've dived into the exciting world of Formula 1 data to analyze the tire strategies employed by drivers in the 2023 Monaco Grand Prix. Using Python and the fastf1 package for data retrieval and matplotlib for data visualization, I've created a stunning visual representation of tire choices during the race.

Each color on the chart represents a specific tire compound, and the length of the bars indicates the number of laps a driver used that particular tire. It's fascinating to see how teams strategized throughout the race.

🌈🏁 What stands out:

I have included graphs from a very interesting 2023 grand prix, the 2023 Monaco Grand prix .
Data analysis isn't just about numbers; it's about telling a story with data. Understanding these tire strategies can give us a glimpse into the complex world of Formula 1 race engineering.
